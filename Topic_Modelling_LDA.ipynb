              "'Azealia Amanda Banks (; born May 31, 1991) is an American rapper, singer, songwriter,  record producer, and actress. Raised in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City, she began releasing music through Myspace in 2008 before being signed to XL Recordings at age 17. In 2011, her single \"212\" went viral and entered several international charts. Banks subsequently signed with Interscope and Polydor Records.\\nBanks has released two mixtapes (Fantasea in 2012 and Slay-Z in 2016), one studio album (Broke with Expensive Taste in 2014), and one extended play (1991 in 2012). Her long-delayed second studio album, Fantasea II: The Second Wave, awaits release; the lead single, \"Anna Wintour\", was released in April 2018. In December 2017, Banks had her feature-film debut in Love Beats Rhymes, receiving positive reviews for her performance as lead actress in a film also featuring Common, Jill Scott, and John David Washington.\\nThroughout her career, Banks\\'s social media presence and outspoken views, especially on U.S. politics and race, have attracted significant controversy, criticism, and media scrutiny. She has developed a reputation for  having disputes with public figures on Twitter.\\n\\n\\n== Life and career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early life and career beginnings ===\\nAzealia Amanda Banks was born on May 31, 1991, in New York City\\'s Manhattan borough; she was the youngest of three girls. Her single mother raised her and two older sisters in Harlem, after their father died of pancreatic cancer when she was two years old. Following her father\\'s death, Banks says that her mother \"became really abusive—physically and verbally. Like she would hit me and my sisters with baseball bats, bang our heads up against walls, and she would always tell me I was ugly. I remember once she threw out all the food in the fridge, just so we wouldn\\'t have anything to eat.\" Due to escalating violence, Banks moved out of her mother\\'s home at age 14 to live with her older sister.At a young age Banks became interested in musical theater, dancing, acting and singing. At age 16, she starred in a production of the comedy-noir musical City of Angels, where she was found by an agent who sent her to auditions for TBS, Nickelodeon, and Law & Order, all without success. At this point Banks decided to end her pursuit of an acting career, citing the stiff competition and overall sense of unfulfillment. Because of this unfulfillment, she began writing rap and R&B songs as a creative outlet. She never finished high school, instead choosing to follow her dream of becoming a recording artist.  On April of 2009, Banks attempted to murder her sister with a box cutter. Under the moniker Miss Bank$, she released her debut recording, \"Gimme a Chance\", online on November 9, 2008. The recording was accompanied by the self-produced track \"Seventeen\", which sampled the Ladytron song of the same name. Banks sent both tracks to American DJ Diplo. Later that year, she signed a development deal with record label XL Recordings and began working with producer Richard Russell in London, leaving the label later that year due to conflicting ideas.\\n\\n\\n=== 2011–2012: 1991 and Fantasea ===\\n\\n After leaving XL Recordings, Banks dropped the \\'Miss Bank$\\' moniker and formally became Azealia Banks, which preceded a move to Montreal. Using YouTube as a portal, she uploaded several demo tracks, including \"L8R\" and a cover of \"Slow Hands\" by Interpol. After her Canadian visa expired, Banks returned to New York, where she sold keychains at a Manhattan jazz club and danced at a Queens strip club to make ends meet. \"That\\'s when I was really depressed\", Banks has said. \"I don\\'t have a manager, I don\\'t have a boyfriend, I don\\'t have any friends, I don\\'t have any money. Here I am working at the strip club, trying not to say the wrong thing and get into fights with these girls who don\\'t give a shit.\"In September 2011, Banks released her debut single, \"212\", as a free digital download from her website. It was released officially on December 6, 2011, as the lead single from her EP 1991. The track attained European moderate chart success, peaking at #14 in the Netherlands, #12 in the United Kingdom and #7 in Ireland.\\nThough unsigned at the time, Banks began working with British producer Paul Epworth on a debut studio album. It was announced in December 2011 that she would feature on \"Shady Love\", a track on American band Scissor Sisters\\' fourth studio album, Magic Hour, though the feature was uncredited. An accompanying music video was released in January 2012 following its radio premiere from Annie Mac (BBC Radio 1) on January 4, though the single\\'s release was canceled for unconfirmed reasons. Banks released the track \"NEEDSUMLUV (SXLND)\" on the Internet on January 16, 2012, coinciding with what would have been the 33rd birthday of the late singer Aaliyah, who is sampled on the track. A week later saw the emergence of a second track, \"Bambi\", produced by Paul Epworth and selected as the soundtrack for a Thierry Mugler fashion show in Paris.In May 2012, Banks announced plans to release a mixtape—originally titled Fantastic—titled Fantasea. Preceding its release the tracks \"Jumanji\", \"Aquababe\", and \"Nathan\" (featuring rapper Styles P) were made available online. Fantasea was released via Banks\\' Twitter account on July 11, and was succeeded by the unveiling of Banks\\' online radio project, Kunt.FM the following week.Banks\\'s first EP, 1991, was released in the UK on May 28 and in the US the next day. The 4-track EP, which includes 212, was not eligible for the UK Albums chart, but the title track charted at #79 on the UK Singles chart. It also reached #133 on the US 200, while reaching #17 on the US R&B/Hip-Hop chart, #12 on the US Rap chart, and headin\\' US Heat chart. In 2013, 1991 was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association.Banks was scheduled to release her second single, \"Esta Noche\", from Fantasea, on September 25, 2012, but it was pulled the day of its release due to sampling disputes between Banks and its producer, Munchi. The next month, it was confirmed that Banks had worked with Lady Gaga on two tracks, \"Ratchet\" and \"Red Flame\", on Gaga\\'s third studio album, Artpop (2013), but they did not make the final album cut, and have since not been released. Banks also revealed that she collaborated with Kanye West on G.O.O.D. Music\\'s compilation album Cruel Summer but that her contributions did not make the final cut. On December 31, 2012, Banks released \"BBD\", which ultimately appeared on her debut album, Broke with Expensive Taste.\\n\\n\\n=== 2013–2017: Broke with Expensive Taste, Slay-Z, and Love Beats Rhymes ===\\n\\nEarly in 2012, Banks revealed that her debut album would be called Broke with Expensive Taste, and said the album would include contributions from musicians including Toko Yasuda, Theophilus London, Kevin Hussein, and Ariel Pink. She initially said the album\\'s lead single would be a track titled \"Miss Amor\" and that it would be accompanied by a B-side, \"Miss Camaraderie\", both produced by Lone, but these plans changed: in January 2013 she announced that the first official single from the album would be \"Yung Rapunxel\", which was released in March 2013 through SoundCloud.In May 2013, Banks announced that the second single from Broke with Expensive Taste would be \"ATM Jam\", featuring Pharrell. On June 29, she debuted the song at the 2013 Glastonbury Festival, with New York City radio station Hot 97 premiering a clean, shortened version of the studio recording three days later. On July 11, the full studio version of \"ATM Jam\" was released on BBC Radio 1, and it was released for digital download on August 30. Banks confirmed in November 2013 that \"ATM Jam\" would not appear on Broke with Expensive Taste due to poor sales.\\n\\nBanks announced in mid-July that after a long battle, she had parted ways with Universal Music Group. She reportedly has possession and the rights to the work she released with Interscope. On July 28, 2014, Banks released the official second single from Broke with Expensive Taste, titled \"Heavy Metal and Reflective\", on her own label, Azealia Banks Records. This was followed by \"Chasing Time\", the third single from the project, on September 22.Banks surprise-released Broke with Expensive Taste under Prospect Park on iTunes on November 7, 2014. The physical album was released on March 3, 2015. In 2015, Banks performed at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and posed nude for the April issue of Playboy, shot by Ellen von Unwerth. In May 2015, it was announced that Banks would make her acting debut as the main character in the RZA-directed musical drama film Coco (now known as Love Beats Rhymes). Months later, Banks revealed that she was unable to release new music until March 2016, but as of February 2016 she was officially cleared of her contract and able to release new music. In February 2016, Banks released a new single, \"The Big Big Beat\", with its official video uploaded to Vevo in April. Her mixtape Slay-Z was released March 24, 2016. In July 2017, Slay-Z was reissued to iTunes, Spotify, and other online music stores under her independent record label, Chaos & Glory Recordings.\\nIn late 2016, Banks opened an online store, CheapyXo. It sells skin-care products, clothing, and celebrity merchandise. After a yearlong hiatus from touring, Banks returned to New York City to embark on a North American tour with 20 dates across the U.S. and Canada. The tour began on October 4 in Chicago and concluded on October 31 in San Francisco. Banks also performed across Europe in a handful of shows during 2017.\\n\\n\\n=== 2018–present: Icy Colors Change, Yung Rapunxel II, Business & Pleasure, and Fantasea II: The Second Wave ===\\n\\nBanks announced that her next project will be Fantasea II: The Second Wave, a follow-up to Fantasea. On February 17, 2017, she released a Lunice collaboration, \"Crown\", to SoundCloud as a promotional single. On June 5, 2017, Banks released the song \"Chi Chi\". On June 26, 2017, Banks released another promotional single to SoundCloud, \"Escapades\".On January 31, 2018, Banks announced that she had signed a $1 million record deal with Entertainment One. On March 9, 2018, she released \"Movin\\' On Up\", which featured Newbody, to iTunes and other streaming platforms as the 4th promotional single from Fantasea II: The Second Wave.

In December 2014 she called for over $100 trillion to be paid to African Americans as financial reparations for the enslavement of their ancestors, citing U.S. reparations to Native American communities and the German reparations to Jewish survivors of the Holocaust as a precedent.

Banks attributes this to her upbringing in Harlem, saying, \"...I\\'m from Harlem. I went to art school; I grew up with the cunts. And that term doesn\\'t come from me! People think I invented it, but I didn\\'t. To be cunty is to be feminine and to be, like, aware of yourself. Nobody\\'s fucking with that inner strength and delicateness. The cunts, the gay men, adore that. My friends would say, \\'Oh you need to cunt it up! You\\'re being too banjee.\\' Banjee means unrefined and rough. You need your cunts: they fix your hair for you and do your makeup. They give you confidence and give you life.\" She is also known for her often fast-paced rapping, or \"flow\". In a review of Banks\\' debut EP 1991, Chris Dart of Exclaim! found Banks\\' rapping speed \"remarkable\", commenting that she \"manages a feat that takes most rappers the better part of a career to master: the perfect marriage of bangin\\', club-friendly beats and smart, crisply delivered lyrics\".Since writing \"212\", Banks has adopted an alter ego named \"Yung Rapunxel\". This alter ego was adapted from Banks referring to herself as Rapunzel, due to a long weave she wore while working at Starbucks as a teenager. Banks discussed this with Rolling Stone saying, \"Yung Rapunxel is that girl who pisses people off but doesn\\'t really mean to. She\\'s actually a sweetheart! But people are so taken aback that she\\'s so herself; she\\'s not even trying to be unique or different. She literally just lives in her head; she does what she wants to do. So, the lipstick is here for someone who is happy to be themself.\"\\n\\n\\n== Controversies ==\\nBanks has developed a reputation for disputes with public figures on social media, particularly Twitter, with Complex noting that \"she gets more attention for her public feuds than she does for her music\".
